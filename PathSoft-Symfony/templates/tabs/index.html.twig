										<p>Learning to program means learning how to solve problems using code. Conceptually it
											is not very difficult to write a program that solves a problem that you can solve
											yourself. The skill you need to acquire is thinking very precisely about how you
											solve the problem and breaking it down into steps that are so simple that a computer
											can execute them. I encourage you to first solve a few instances of a problem by
											hand and think about what you did to find the solution. For example if the task is
											sorting lists, sort some short lists yourself.</p>
